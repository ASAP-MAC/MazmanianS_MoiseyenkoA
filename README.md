## Research Objective
To determine whether introducing beneficial microbes (*Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* alone vs. a beneficial commensal consortium) shifts gut microbial communities in Parkinson’s disease (PD) mouse models by:  
1. Increasing beneficial commensal microbes  
2. Reducing potentially pathogenic microbes  
3. Comparing the efficacy of *F. prausnitzii* (Fp) alone versus the beneficial commensal community (benCom) in driving these changes

## Experimental Design

### Animal Models
- **Wildtype (WT)** mice and **alpha-synuclein overexpressing (ASO)** mice, which model PD-like symptoms.  
- Treatment duration: **5 to 22 weeks of age**, with gavage administered twice per week.  

### Treatment Groups
| Cohort             | Treatment                                                  | Sample label |  
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|  
| **Wild type (WT)** | Vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] with sodium bicarbonate)      | W    |
| **Alpha-synuclein overexpression Control (ASO-C)**        | Vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] with sodium bicarbonate) | C          |  
| **Alpha-synuclein overexpression + F. prausnitzii (ASO-FP)**             | *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* (Fp)  | F          |  
| **Alpha-synuclein overexpression + beneficial commensals (ASO-bC)**         | A cocktail of 8 beneficial commensal microbes including Fp, all major producers of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and reduced in the PD microbiome | B          |  

### Outcome Assessments
- Motor and gastrointestinal (GI) function tested at **20 to 21 weeks of age**.  
- Fecal microbiome analysis performed post-treatment.

## Key Methods

### Sample Collection
- Fecal pellets from the Fp cohort were collected **less than 24 hours after the last gavage**.  
- Fecal pellets from the benCom cohort were collected **2 days after the last gavage**.  
- Collection protocol:  
  1. Pellets collected fresh in a biosafety cabinet.  
  2. Mice placed individually in sterile plastic cups until defecation.  
  3. Pellets scooped with sterile tubes, flash-frozen, and stored at **-80°C**.  
  4. All samples collected and processed by the same experimenter to reduce variability.  

### DNA Extraction & Analysis
- DNA extracted from fecal samples to assess shifts in microbial community composition.

## Key Findings
- Both Fp and benCom treatments improved motor and GI dysfunction in ASO mice compared to vehicle controls.  
- Microbiome data pending to determine:  
  - Whether Fp alone can drive community shifts or if benCom’s combined microbes provide a more robust effect.  
  - Changes in abundance of pathogenic versus beneficial commensal microbes.  

---

## Implications
- Findings may inform microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease.  
- Suggests potential superiority of multi-strain microbial consortia (benCom) over single-strain interventions (Fp).
